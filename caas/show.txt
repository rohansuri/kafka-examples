Legend:
>> To show

High level

Producer:
Producer produces stream of operations, example
+1, +2, *3, ....
Keyed by userid
It should take these from stdin

We probably would need another version "FastProducer"
That quickly produces first N natural numbers, given N as parameter?
>> To show batching in effect

>> Partitioning strategy (hash on userid)

Target topic:
"Calculate" 
num.of.partitions=2

>> Show two different user ids nicely getting hashed to two different partitions
   (i.e enter directory on server and show different log segments maintained in different
   directories)

>> iostat no activity for broker pid (everything happens with page cache)

>> consumer group first with only one consumer then two
   partition rebalance and start producing newer messages and show how now the two messages are 
   consumed by two different consumers

Finally we show compacted output topic "Calculated"
>> Show compacted results for each user
For this we need to set the segment size really small, so that it only holds one entry
(pretty predictable after seeing userid size + operation size)
The log compaction lag also should be 0
And retention check should be low too
(make note...all of this only for the demo)

important:
anytime you want to show something, that'd require a property change
for example, index.interval.bytes?
create a topic, produce to that and show it
don't modify your original topics
that's your demo
nothing should go unpredictable/unthought of before
